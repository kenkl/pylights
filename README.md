# pylights
### A Python frontend for Philips Hue Bridge

Experiments with using Python3 to replicate some of the behaviours that [Lights](https://github.com/kenkl/lights) has. In an ideal world, we'd maintain parity between lightkit.py and functions.php, but that's not especially critical right onow.

2021-03-06 - Since implementing fakesun.py, I'm having more ideas about fun things I could do with pylights, and maybe drift away from [Lights](https://github.com/kenkl/lights) and its abandonware library. I've moved updates to [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/kenkl/pylights/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) to track, if only for future-me's benefit, changes I make along the way.
