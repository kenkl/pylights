# pylights
### A Python frontend for Philips Hue Bridge

Experiments with using Python3 to replicate some of the behaviours that [Lights](https://github.com/kenkl/lights) has. In an ideal world, we'd maintain parity between lightkit.py and functions.php, but that's not especially critical right onow.

One conscious/deliberate difference is function naming. Although I generally follow the convention for [camelCase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case) in functions.php over in [Lights](https://github.com/kenkl/lights), I'm not doing that here with lightkit.py. As a general rule, I like to avoid [Bucky bits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucky_bit) at the CLI whenever possible, as I'm developing/testing things via the Python REPL. Lazy? Probably.

2021-03-06 - Since implementing fakesun.py, I'm having more ideas about fun things I could do with pylights, and maybe drift away from [Lights](https://github.com/kenkl/lights) and its abandonware library. I've moved updates to [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/kenkl/pylights/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) to track, if only for future-me's benefit, changes I make along the way.
