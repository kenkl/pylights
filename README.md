# pylights
### A Python frontend for Philips Hue Bridge

Experiments with using Python3 to replicate some of the behaviours that [Lights](https://github.com/kenkl/lights) has. In an ideal world, we'd maintain parity between lightkit.py and functions.php, but that's not especially critical right onow.

One conscious/deliberate difference is function naming. Although I generally follow the convention for [camelCase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case) in functions.php over there, I'm not doing that here with lightkit.py. As a general rule, I like to avoid [Bucky bits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucky_bit) at the CLI whenever possible. Lazy? Probably.
